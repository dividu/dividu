# DiViDu an Open Source Solution for Dual Task Experiments with integrated Divided Visual Field Paradigm

## Installation

The software requires [.NET Framework version 4.6.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49981).
It should be already installed on recently updated versions of Windows 7, 8, 10, 2008, and 2012.

Download the installer of the [latest release]() and follow the installation procedure.

On successful installation you should find a link to DiViDu in your start menu.
From there you can test the software by using the default settings and the packaged [sample word list](/triallist/wordListEng.csv).
The default installation location is `C:\Program Files (x86)\DiViDu` where also a copy of the sample word list `wordListEng.csv` is located.

## Developing

The software was developed using Visual Studio 2017.
[Visual Studio 2017 can be obtained free of charge from Microsoft.](https://www.visualstudio.com/)
